<p>Hi! My name is Erica Garcia! I received my degree in design, minor in Spanish, and cognate in 
math and science from Michigan State University. Graduating from the Honors College, I was able to pursue my interests and took on additional course work and 
projects. I gave memorable presentations to groups of over 150, created a variety of stop motion animations with 
photography and graphics, as well as designed websites and my very own animated game characters. During my life I have always given back whenever I could, teaching a PHD 
student English, volunteering in Detroit and the Mid-Michigan cat rescue, and even traveling to Jamaica with 11 other students to work with children ranging from 3-15 years old, helping 
them both in the classroom and by painting the walls and installing new flooring into their school. 
That being said, my primary goal in life is to give back to the world. So while the future is 
never predictable, I know one thing for a fact, Iâ€™ll always be working to make a difference whether 
it is through teaching, helping others or through great design.</p>
