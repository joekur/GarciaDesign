<p>Hi! My name is Erica Garcia! I received my degree in design, minor in Spanish, and cognate in 
math and science from Michigan State University. I graduated from the Honors College gaining unique experiences by pursing my interests and taking on additional course work and 
projects. Some of my experiences include giving presentations to groups of over 150, creating a variety of stop motion animations with 
both photography and graphics, designing websites and my very own animated game characters. While at MSU I also tried my best to give back whenever I could, teaching a PHD 
student English, volunteering at the Mid-Michigan cat rescue and in Detroit, and even traveling to Jamaica with 11 other students to work with children ranging from 3-15 years old, helping 
them both in the classroom and by painting the walls and installing new flooring in their school. 
That being said, my primary goal in life is to give back to the world. So while the future is 
never predictable, I know one thing for a fact, Iâ€™ll always be working to make a difference whether 
it is through teaching, helping others or through great design.</p>
