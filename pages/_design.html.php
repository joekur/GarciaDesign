			  Detail of text which includes a quote about nature by Osho, an indian spiritual leader. "Look at the trees, look at the birds, 
			  look at the clouds, look at the stars... and if you have eyes you will be able to see that the whole existence is joyful. 
			  Everything is simply happy. Trees are happy for no reason; they are not going to become prime ministers or presidents and they 
			  are not going to become rich and they will never have any bank balance. Look at the flowers - for no reason. 
			  It is simply unbelievable how happy flowers are."
