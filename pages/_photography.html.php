			<p>My favorite type of photography is that of accidental beauty. I love capturing someones true emotion, 
			stance, and motion. An example of this can be found in the top left photo. This particular girl was anything but camera 
			shy and I had no problem getting her to smile. When her bow became loose she stopped to re-tie it, and as she did 
			I snapped the photo. She and her mom immediately thought I had made a mistake, but when the photos came back they 
			couldn't resist this image.</p>
